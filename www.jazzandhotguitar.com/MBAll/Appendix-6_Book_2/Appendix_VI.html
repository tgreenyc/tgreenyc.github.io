<p align="left">This appendix covers Volume 2 of Mickey's course.&nbsp; Perhaps 
one is asking why I just didn't add it to the end of Volume 1 as a continuation?&nbsp; 
Mickey wrote Volume 2 four years after Volume 1 was released.&nbsp; He states in 
the cover page that although the layout is similar to Volume 1, the content is 
not.&nbsp; Volume 1 teaches us chord substitutions and how to improvise a single 
string lead both as totally new melody or improvising around a melody.&nbsp; 
Volume 2 is probably best described as how to do chordal improvisations in a 
continuance of the Lessons 50, 51, and 52 of Volume 1, some new theory, and 
filling in some holes from the first volume.&nbsp; Because of this change in 
teaching, I find it difficult to maintain any continuity with the presentation 
of the second volume to that of the first.</p>
<p align="left">To me, Volume 2 has always felt like more of an appendix to 
Volume 1 than a continuation at Lesson 53.&nbsp; To put this book into TablEdit, 
I've had to use quite a bit of imagination.&nbsp; I'm still maintaining my role 
as a fellow student, rather than as a teacher.&nbsp; Some of the lessons will be 
similar to the ones from Volume 1 and some will be outside material relative to 
the lesson.&nbsp; I'll be asking you to be patient and accept that I've done the 
best that I could for the particular lesson.</p>
<p align="left">I also have written this for the &quot;graduate&quot; of Volume 1 and 
assume one is as fluent in TablEdit as it was necessary to be to go through 
Volume 1.&nbsp; I constantly refer back to previous lessons.&nbsp; If you have 
not gone through Volume 1 from this website, then you may find the frustration 
level surpassing the fun level.</p>
<p align="left">Where applicable, I've added material to help the fingerstyle 
jazz guitarist just as I did throughout the Volume 1 lessons.&nbsp; Mickey 
suggests doing one lesson per week until all 26 are completed, and then starting 
over as if it's the first time we've seen the course.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="left">For the sake of consistency and a minimum of confusion, I've 
tried to standardize the nomenclature of the Volume 2 lessons to be consistent 
with the Volume 1 lessons.&nbsp; Mickey changed his chord notation style in 
Volume 2.&nbsp; Also, Volume 2 contains many errors, I believe, due to lack of 
proofreading the finished document.&nbsp; As I did with Volume 1, I've called 
attention to many of these errors, tried to repair them in the exercises, and suggested possible corrections. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Here's my promise to do my best to keep it FUN!&nbsp; 
Remember it's easier to learn with a smile on your face.</p>
