<span style="font-size:14.0pt">Notes to Appendix VI - Lesson 2</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Appendix VI - Lesson 2 gives four exercises in resolving 
four different chord forms that were introduced to us in Lesson 1.&nbsp; Two 
chords are major forms and two are minor's.&nbsp; After a year of study in 
Volume 1, perhaps you're thinking that resolving to a simple triad is a step 
backwards.&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't worry about that as Appendix VI - Lesson 3 will 
bring it back on track.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Mickey asks us to practice these forms from the 1st to the 
10th fret.&nbsp; I've expanded that to include the open position and the 11th 
fret so that you'll have a full chromatic scale.&nbsp; Until your left pinkie 
becomes accustomed to the stretches, you're going to have a problem with the 
positions nearest the nut.&nbsp; I know I did and still am not 100% comfortable.&nbsp; 
Let me suggest that for the first few days of work on this lesson, just 
concentrate on the forms between positions 5 through 9.&nbsp; When a certain 
degree of comfort and confidence breaks through, add Position 4.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Note that in the open positions, we use a little different 
fingering.&nbsp; I'm certain Mickey avoided these to cater to the publishing 
restraints, as we talked about in Volume 1.&nbsp; We have A min, A Maj, E min, 
and E Maj forms in the open position.&nbsp; Since these chords are very useful 
in common keys such as C and G, I have included them.&nbsp; If this is a little 
too much for the time being, just skip them, but remember that the 2nd time we 
go through this volume (remember Mickey's advice in the introduction?), we'll 
add them. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One additional benefit provided by the open positions is 
that we can play these forms as full 6-string chords.&nbsp; These forms can be 
used, for example, as an ending chord:&nbsp; </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">I'm sure you're thinking that these open forms 
are quite a bit easier to finger than their cousins a position or two higher.&nbsp; 
And if you're like me, you're thinking of an appropriate tune to insert one of 
these beauties, aren't you?</p>
