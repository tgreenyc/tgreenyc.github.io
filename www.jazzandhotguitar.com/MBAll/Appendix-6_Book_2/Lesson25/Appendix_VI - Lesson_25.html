<span style="font-size: 14pt;">Notes to Appendix VI - Lesson 25</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;" align="center">The study of 
counterpoint has been the pinnacle of study for composers for more than 300 
years.&nbsp; The roots of Counterpoint can be traced to the Renaissance Era and it 
may be older than that.&nbsp; No one ever did more or was better than Mr. 
Counterpoint, J. S. Bach.&nbsp; His Art of the Fugue covered probably the most 
difficult and complex of all the forms of music, the Fugue, and one which all 
great composers since have revered.&nbsp; Jazz is no stranger to counterpoint and 
today's Jazz groups often excel in inventing two- and three-part inventions, as 
Bach would have called them.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;" align="center">In the late 1960's 
we all were introduced to Bach through the music of the Jazz-Rock group, Jethro 
Tull, and its flautist Ian Anderson playing the Bourree in E minor from the 1st 
Lute Suite.&nbsp; This piece&nbsp; was in 2-part harmony.&nbsp; It is a long time favorite 
of classical guitarists, and guitarists that aren't particularly interested in 
classical music.&nbsp; Look at the walking bass in the 1st part of that classic (the 
entire composition is in the TEF section of this lesson):</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center">
<img border="0" src="Bach%20Bourree.jpg" width="922" height="595"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><font size="4"><b>Bourr<span lang="es">ée 
BWV996 by J. S. Bach </span>(the 1st Part)</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;" align="center">This example by 
Bach is the first or A part of a two-part composition.&nbsp; Look at the standard 
notation not as music, but rather as a piece of visual art.&nbsp; Note how the lines 
come close to each other and then spread out.&nbsp; In a video he recorded about 
acoustic jazz guitar techniques, Charlie Byrd tells us that we can practically 
never go wrong when one instrument's melody is ascending and the other's counter 
melody is descending and vice-versa.&nbsp; It's when both (or all) voices go in the 
same direction that causes us problems.&nbsp; Charlie Byrd's music is particularly 
interesting in a study of counterpoint.&nbsp; He was a classically trained musician 
that formally studied music composition, as many great Jazz musicians such as 
Dizzy Gillespie and Dave Brubeck.&nbsp; His arrangements for his groups always showed 
this training.&nbsp; He particularly liked to improvise single note lines against 
another instrument such as a bass or a solo instrument.&nbsp; Here is an example of 
Charlie's counterpoint from his recording of the Duke Ellington classic &quot;I Let A 
Song Go Out of My Heart&quot;:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center">
<img border="0" src="Ellington%20Fragment.jpg" width="949" height="285"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><b><font size="4">Counterpoint in a 
Turn-around by Charlie Byrd</font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;" align="center">&quot;I Let A Song Go 
Out Of My Heart&quot; has an A1, A2, B(ridge), A2 structure.&nbsp; The above example of a 
turn-around occurs in at the end of the A1 part.&nbsp; In the TEF's for this lesson 
there is a complete transcription of the recording for your study.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;" align="center">As kids we became 
exposed to counterpoint by singing children's canons, like &quot;Row, Row, Row Your 
Boat.&quot;&nbsp; Canons are an important part of Counterpoint.&nbsp; Some of us have even 
gotten married to the music of the famous Canon in D by Johann Pachelbel.&nbsp; 
Continuing our study of the works of Charlie Byrd, here is a fragment of the 
famous &quot;Theme from Love Story&quot; by Fran<span lang="es">çis Lai.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Charlie is playing one melody and his brother Joe is playing a counter melody in 
the style of a canon </span>(the entire transcription also appears in the TEF's 
for this lesson):</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center">
<img border="0" src="Lai%20Fragment.jpg" width="916" height="623"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><b><font size="4">A Psuedo-Canon Between 
Guitar and Bass</font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">Charlie starts the interplay in the 2nd 
measure of our example, while the bass is tacet.&nbsp; In the 3rd measure the 
bass imitates the guitarŽs 2nd measure while the guitar is continuing the cantus 
firmus.&nbsp; Note that the bass is not playing an exact copy of the the 
guitarŽs melody, but it is close enough that our ears cause us to think &quot;oh wow!&nbsp; 
A canon.&quot;&nbsp; (well, some of us at least.)&nbsp; There's only about 8 measures 
of that, as undoubtedly Charlie is remembering our earlier stated Bryl-creme axiom 
&quot;A little dab'll do ya!&quot;.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;" align="center">A soloing 
instrument playing against a bassist who is also improvising is the backbone of 
exciting Jazz.&nbsp; A popular expression for a widely used bass technique is the 
&quot;walking bass&quot;.&nbsp; There are a few fingerstyle guitarists that have based their 
careers on this technique.&nbsp; Blues recordings from the 1920's and 1930's 
have many examples of walking bass, or counterpoint.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;" align="center">Listen to the 
music of any traditional Dixieland group, and one will hear 3-, 4-, 5-part 
harmony, all being improvised on the spot.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;" align="center">Since the 
Renaissance Era, classical counterpoint has had some strict rules, such as avoid 
parallel octaves, unisons, or fifths, unless we have a good reason like 
accentuating a phrase.&nbsp; But when we do that, we lose our counterpoint and are 
just emphasizing a single melody.&nbsp;&nbsp; Refer to Charlie Byrd's example above 
of &quot;I Let A Song Go Out Of My Heart.&quot;&nbsp; In the first measure Charlie plays 
the melody as octaves to emphasize it.&nbsp; Some guitarists, notably Wes 
Montgomery, made a career out of an octave style.&nbsp; When used sparingly, 
such as this example, it focuses our ears.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;" align="center">With such an 
important and complex subject, I have always been a bit bewildered wondering why 
Mickey gives so little attention to Counterpoint, with one lesson? </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;" align="center"><b>About the 
Exercises:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mickey has given us four exercises with examples of 
counterpoint.&nbsp; All of the examples are from previous exercises from this 
volume.&nbsp; As they are very short, I've combined Exercises 62, 63, and 64 into one 
TEF.</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;" align="center">Exercise 62 
	has us hold two notes while the bass line moves down then up.</li>
	<li>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;" align="center">Exercise 63 
	starts with the same chord but the melody line is also moving with chords on 
	beats 1 and 3.</li>
	<li>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;" align="center">Exercise 64 is 
	essentially the same as Exercise 63 except the chords' extra voices are 
	removed to give us to single note lines.&nbsp; Note it simplifies fingering 
	somewhat.</li>
	<li>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;" align="center">Exercise 65 is 
	taken from Lesson 19's Exercise 49, &quot;Everything Happens To Me.&quot;&nbsp; Instead of 
	the accompaniment of arpeggios on the guitar, Mickey uses the bass notes of 
	the arpeggio as half notes giving us the counter melody.&nbsp; I've included a 
	variation of Exercise 65 with the countermelody dropped an octave where 
	possible.&nbsp; Compare it to Mickey's original, not as one might be better than 
	the other, but rather now you have two different tools in your tool box</li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;" align="center"><b>In Summary:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Counterpoint adds interest to any phrase by dividing the attention.&nbsp; Although 
the technique transgresses musical periods, it adds a fresh take on practically 
any arrangement from any musical period.&nbsp; .Counterpoint techniques can be used 
in writing bass lines for our arrangements, in addition to using it for the 
guitar part.&nbsp; It is still another extremely useful tool for our tool box. Many 
community colleges offer a Counterpoint course from their music departments.&nbsp; 
This is a great way learn more about this musical technique and to meet and make 
friends with folks of like interests.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Have fun with your new found tool!</p>
