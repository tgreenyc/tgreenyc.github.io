<p STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mickey gives us fragments of two Swing Era tunes, 
&quot;This Love of Mine&quot; and &quot;I Dream of You&quot;, using the stretch chord techniques of 
Lessons 1 through 5.&nbsp; In the TEF's I created of the two exercises, I put 
the melody staff with a tenor sax voice, but I muted it to avoid conflict with 
the guitar lead.&nbsp; And I created a third staff for rhythm guitar, using one 
of the variations of the ii9 - V13b9 - I7 progressions we studied and reviewed 
in Lesson 6.</p>
<p STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These two examples really whetted my appetite for 
a full arrangement.&nbsp; Looking ahead I saw that in Lesson 11, Mickey obliges 
us.&nbsp; Perhaps by that lesson our fingers will have become accustomed to the 
stretches and we are comfortable with them.</p>
<p STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mickey doesn't ask us to transpose either of these 
lessons, so there are just the two TEF's.&nbsp; In Exercise 13, Mickey combines 
a Chord Form 1 with a Chord Form 15 to give us a really busy form he calls a 
&quot;Dm6 9&quot;.&nbsp; In the last measure of that exercise, he does the same thing with 
Chord Form's 4 and 17, calling it a &quot;CMaj6 9.&quot;&nbsp; In exercise 14, he just 
gives us the forms as numbers in circles.</p>
<p STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Errata:&nbsp; In Exercise 14, the D, B, and A 
notes should be triplet quarter notes.&nbsp; As written, the measure has 5 
beats.&nbsp; I double checked Lesson 11 to confirm my suspicions.&nbsp; </p>
<p STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Since this lesson is a little short, we can spend 
more time on our standards project we started way back in Lesson 17.&nbsp; Be on 
the lookout for opportunities to insert our new chord forms.</p>
<p STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As always, make it FUN!!</p>
