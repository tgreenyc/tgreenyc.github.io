<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:left">
Lesson 25 continues with the right hand development we started in Lesson 24.&nbsp; 
Lesson 24 has a number of scales that we can continue to work on not only in 
Lesson 25 but throughout our study.&nbsp; As the new workload from Lesson 24 was 
extensive, I'm not adding any additional exercises.&nbsp; If any of you are like 
me, you'll find Lesson 24's Bonus Scale Fingering 4 (F# through B), a year's 
study in itself!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:left">
As one student to another talking about the course over a cup of coffee, I have 
to say that this is my least favorite of all the lessons in this course.&nbsp; I 
understand the need for it, but it's a little like my mother saying &quot;eat those 
peas and carrots; they're good for you&quot; when I really wanted to dig into the 
fried chicken.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:left">
All of the notes about picking preferences I gave you in Lesson 24 also apply to 
Lesson 25 and the remaining lessons.&nbsp; By now you probably have made a 
decision as to how you want to use your right hand and I'm not going to dwell on 
this.&nbsp; In fact, this is the last lesson I've given different right hand 
examples.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:left">
Don't forget to continue building your Standards notebook (that, by now is 
really a portfolio), and please share with 
us what you create.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Just keep it FUN!&nbsp; </p>
