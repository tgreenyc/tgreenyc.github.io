I'm assuming that you're studying these lessons in order; therefore, let me 
emphasize that everything we talked about in the first two lessons of this 
appendix apply to arranging for a larger ensemble.&nbsp; Take a few minutes and 
do a quick review.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:left">
I studied arranging and orchestration in a night school class at a local junior 
college.&nbsp; It was a wonderful experience, one of the highlights of my 
college studies, and I can't recommend more enthusiastically for you to pursue a 
similar course.&nbsp; If your local junior or community college has a music 
department, visit it to learn more about what's available.&nbsp; If a course on 
arranging and orchestration isn't available, ask for one.&nbsp; In my particular 
case, the college needed at least 10 students to justify the course, and we were 
able to get about 30.&nbsp; Don't worry about your qualifications, because as a 
graduate of Mickey's course, you'll be light years ahead of most folks in areas 
like harmony and creating solos.&nbsp; Additionally, you'll find you'll have a 
number of different instruments that will give you many choices for your 
arrangements.&nbsp; Generally, courses like this appeal to musicians that want 
to learn rather than take an elective to fill out graduation requirements.&nbsp; 
Not only will you learn from the course, but you'll meet a number of musicians 
that have a similar interest in arranging.&nbsp; That's how you can have an 
occasional &quot;Sax Section&quot;, or &quot;Woodwind quintet&quot;, and they can get a versatile 
guitarist.&nbsp; I dare say that you'll make new musical friendships that will 
continue after the course completion.&nbsp; Have I sold you on the idea yet?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:left">
As the possibilities for large ensembles are practically infinite, let's talk 
about the group in general and your guitar part in particular.&nbsp; When I 
listen to large ensembles, I'm always reminded of an accordion effect.&nbsp; 
Rarely, does the entire group play together the whole arrangement, but rather, 
it plays together, then thins out while someone is soloing, comes together, 
thins out, etc.&nbsp; Arguably, the father of the modern concept of a symphony 
orchestra, Hector Berlioz, himself a guitarist, wrote that &quot;the guitar is a 
miniature orchestra.&quot;&nbsp; Applying that to arranging music for guitar and 
ensemble, don't duplicate parts unless you have a good reason for doing so.&nbsp; 
That is to say, limit the guitar's harmony when the orchestra is playing along 
with the guitar.&nbsp;&nbsp; That goes for the other polytonal instruments as 
well.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:left">
During the &quot;thin&quot; sections, that is, when someone is soloing, the writing 
becomes identical to arranging for a trio of lead instrument, bass or rhythm 
section with percussion that we discussed in Lesson 2 of this appendix.&nbsp; 
The &quot;thick&quot; sections are what we need to concentrate on.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:left">
One technique&nbsp; that is easy to learn and works is to write a part for a 
polytonal instrument like a piano, organ, or guitar and then divide it into 
individual lines of music to be given to each instrument.&nbsp; If your harmony 
sounds good on the guitar, then it will sound good on any group of instruments.&nbsp; 
An advantage of having a group effort is the ability to write close spaced 
&quot;chord clusters&quot;.&nbsp; Due to the guitar's tuning, a combination of fourth's 
with a Major third, playing close harmony of more than three notes becomes 
difficult and often physically impossible.&nbsp; In one of the early lessons in 
Mickey's course, we said that if our bass player plays a C note, and we 
guitarists play an E min7, the audience hears a C Maj9.&nbsp; We write our 
melody note and then we put the next closest note of the chord.&nbsp; We 
continue until we have our 4-part harmony.&nbsp; A simple work around is do 
write the guitar part of 4 notes with the melody as the highest note.&nbsp; Then 
raise the bass or the lowest note up an octave.&nbsp; The following example 
illustrates this technique:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="center">
<font size="4"><b>Converting Guitar Harmony to Close Spaced Harmony</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
This example is taken from the first two measures of the Sax section of Tommy 
Dorsey's &quot;I'm Getting Sentimental Over You&quot;.&nbsp; In the first two measures, we 
have I (tonic) harmony going to VII7 harmony (or D to C#7).&nbsp; Using the Maj7 
to Maj6 substitution, and also stylizing the melody, we write the harmony as 
close as it is practical on the guitar.&nbsp; D Maj7 to a series of D Maj6 or B 
min7 forms and the 2nd measure, we start with a C#7 sus4 to a C#7.&nbsp; Play it 
on your guitar.&nbsp;&nbsp; Look at the standard notation.&nbsp; The chords are 
as closed spaced as possible on the guitar (without tricks like open strings), 
but they still appear very open.&nbsp; In measures 3 and 4, we take the lowest 
or bass notes and raise them an octave.&nbsp; The standard notation shows we 
have as close spaced chords as Maj7 and Maj6 are.&nbsp; But the TAB staff shows 
a very unplayable-on-the-guitar chord progression.&nbsp;&nbsp; But we can play 
any single line there.&nbsp; For example, let's give the guitar the highest 
line, our fictional alto saxophonist the 2nd line, our fictional tenor 
saxophonist the 3rd line, and our fictional trombonist the 4th or lowest line.&nbsp; 
(Note the &quot;Octave&quot; symbol on the treble clef indicating that the notes will 
sound an octave lower than written.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
BTW, this handy trick works in reverse as well.&nbsp; We can take close spaced 
harmony, and drop the 2nd highest note an octave and have a playable chord 
progression on the guitar.&nbsp; Using this trick over the years, I've 
discovered lots of chord progressions with voicings I never would have figured 
out on my own.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
Once we harmonize the selected section, we'll divide it into lines, and match 
the lines with the instruments.&nbsp; Here a little familiarity with the range 
of instruments is a must.&nbsp; I suggest that in your Standards Portfolio, you 
make a folder with a name such as &quot;Instrument Ranges&quot;.&nbsp; As you work with 
different instruments, you add their characteristics.&nbsp; You can also 
research each instrument on the Internet and add it.&nbsp; One additional tip is 
to ask instrumentalists for their input.&nbsp; I have a friend that is a 
guitarist and trombonist.&nbsp; When I write a trombone part, I ask him to 
critique it.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
After creating our arrangement and cleaning up all the little &quot;gotcha's&quot;, it's 
time to break it into individual parts to hand to the members of our orchestra.&nbsp; 
There are several different ways of doing this in TablEdit.&nbsp; Probably the 
easiest is to make copies of the TEF and add the instrument in the title of the 
copy.&nbsp; For example, Jose's Blues-guitar, Jose's Blues-bass, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
In each TEF, go to Files&gt;Options&gt;Multitrack.&nbsp; Delete all the unwanted parts 
in that TEF by clicking on the checked boxes to remove the checks.&nbsp; To 
check your work, you can play the TEF on your computer.&nbsp; Although the only 
module displayed is the desired one, all the parts will sound in the playback.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
A second method is to copy each MIDI model to a new TEF.&nbsp; It takes a little 
longer, and there is always the chance of making a mistake.&nbsp; However, you 
can edit each TEF to get rid of blank measures.&nbsp; Another reason for using 
this method is if your orchestra has Bb or Eb instruments, you're going to have 
to transpose those parts.&nbsp; When a Bb instrument, such as a clarinet, 
saxophone, trumpet plays a note written as a &quot;C&quot;, it comes out a Bb.&nbsp; If 
your TEF is written in C, then on paper, your Bb instruments must be written as 
if they are in the key of D.&nbsp; Did a little light come on and you now see 
why we studied Bb, Eb, Ab, and Db during Mickey's course?&nbsp; Bb horns will 
have parts written in C, F, Bb, and Eb for those keys.&nbsp; In addition, there 
are a number of Eb instruments (when they play a &quot;C&quot;, it sounds like Eb) such as 
soprano, alto, and baritone saxophones, alto clarinets, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; Eb must 
be written (usually up) to C, Bb to G, Ab to F, and Db to Bb.&nbsp;&nbsp; Always 
remember that a call to the player of the Bb or Eb instrument will usually clear 
up an questions you may have.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:left">
<b>Extra study:&nbsp; </b>Continue listening to the great groups in the history 
of recorded music, not only those that feature the guitar, but other ideas.&nbsp; 
Continue with your Standards portfolio (the more you have in it, the more 
research material you have available.&nbsp; Try to find a used copy of the 
brilliant textbook&nbsp; &quot;Arranging and Orchestration&quot; by Russell Garcia (I know 
this must seem like &quot;déjà vu&quot;, but I can't emphasize enough what a great 
reference this textbook is.)&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Just keep it FUN!&nbsp; </p>
